# vest-il-2020

Our final election results validation report for this dataset is available [here](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2020-illinois-precinct-and-election-results/).

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed. 

Please reach out to info@redistrictingdatahub.org to reach our support team if you have any questions, or if you would like to request a full validation report.
